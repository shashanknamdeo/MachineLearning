stationary time series : series having 
1. constant mean and
2. constant variance and 
3. not having seasonality

non-stationary time series : series whis is not stationary


Corelation : An indicator of relationship between two variable. value of corelations is in range between (1,-1)

Auto-Corelation : corelation of variable with its previous values (lags).

Auto-Corelation function : direct and indirect effect of previous values (lags).

Partial auto-Corelation function : only direct effect of previous values (lags).

auto-regresion : use past values to predect future

moving average modals : use past error to predect future values.

ARMA (auto-regresion moving average) modal : use past values and past error to predict the future.

ARIMA (auto-regresion integgrated moving average) modal : use past values and past error to predict the future by converting non-stationary time series to stationary time series using difference current value with perevious value.

vector auto regression modal : use its past value as well as other variable past values to predict future value.
